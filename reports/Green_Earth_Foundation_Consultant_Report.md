## Executive Summary

Green Earth Foundation engaged our firm to conduct a comprehensive information security assessment and develop a compliance framework aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and ISO 27001:2022. This report summarizes our findings and provides actionable recommendations for strengthening the organization's security posture.

### Key Findings
- **Current Security Maturity**: Level 2 (Defined) - Basic policies exist but implementation is inconsistent
- **Priority Risk Areas**: 3 critical, 7 high, 12 medium findings identified
- **Compliance Gap**: 23% of NIST CSF controls not implemented
- **Estimated Implementation Timeline**: 6-12 months for full compliance

### Investment Summary
- **Immediate (0-3 months)**: $15,000 - Critical security controls
- **Short-term (3-6 months)**: $25,000 - Core infrastructure hardening
- **Medium-term (6-12 months)**: $10,000 - Advanced monitoring and training

**Total ROI**: Estimated $180,000 in avoided breach costs and regulatory penalties

## Top 5 Critical Risks

### ðŸ”´ Critical Risk #1: Inadequate Access Controls
**Impact**: High - Unrestricted access to donor database and financial systems
**Likelihood**: High - No multi-factor authentication on critical systems
**Business Impact**: Potential $50K-$200K in breach costs, regulatory penalties, donor trust loss
**Recommendation**: Implement MFA within 30 days, review all user access permissions
**Estimated Cost**: $5,000 implementation + $200/month ongoing

### ðŸ”´ Critical Risk #2: Unencrypted Data Storage
**Impact**: High - Donor PII and financial data stored without encryption
**Likelihood**: Medium - Laptops and backup drives not encrypted
**Business Impact**: $100K+ GDPR/state privacy law penalties if data exposed
**Recommendation**: Full disk encryption on all devices, encrypted backup solutions
**Estimated Cost**: $3,000 for encryption deployment

### ðŸ”´ Critical Risk #3: No Incident Response Plan
**Impact**: High - No structured response to security incidents
**Likelihood**: Medium - Eventually all organizations face security incidents
**Business Impact**: Extended downtime, regulatory reporting failures, reputation damage
**Recommendation**: Develop and test incident response procedures
**Estimated Cost**: $8,000 for plan development and staff training

### ðŸŸ¡ High Risk #4: Outdated Systems
**Impact**: Medium - Multiple systems missing critical security patches
**Likelihood**: High - No formal patch management process
**Business Impact**: Increased vulnerability to known exploits
**Recommendation**: Implement automated patch management, system inventory
**Estimated Cost**: $4,000 setup + $500/month managed services

### ðŸŸ¡ High Risk #5: Insufficient Staff Training
**Impact**: Medium - Staff unaware of phishing and social engineering tactics
**Likelihood**: High - No formal security awareness program
**Business Impact**: High probability of successful phishing attacks
**Recommendation**: Quarterly security training, phishing simulations
**Estimated Cost**: $2,000 annual training program
