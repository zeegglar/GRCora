Status: FAILED - Infrastructure Issues

UNIT TESTS
----------
Status: NOT CONFIGURED
Error: npm error Missing script: "test"
Coverage: N/A - No tests configured
Files below 80%: Cannot determine (no test framework)

Required Actions:
- Add Jest or Vitest configuration
- Create test suite for core functions
- Implement unit tests for sanitization utilities
- Add component testing for React components

Ingestion Pipeline: ERROR - Missing environment variables
Vector Upsert: ERROR - Database connection failed
Retrieval Endpoint: ERROR - Cannot query without database

Test Commands:
> npm run test-rag
> npm run ingest-nist

Exit Codes:
- test-rag: 0 (but with errors)
- ingest-nist: 1 (environment error)

E2E TESTS
---------
Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
Framework: None configured
Smoke Test: Manual verification only

Critical Path Test Results:
❌ Sign-in → Environment notice shown (no real auth)
❌ Upload/ingest JSONL → Environment configuration required
❌ Build index → Database connection failed
❌ Ask retrieval question → RPC function not available
❌ Generate policy → Completed using mock data
❌ Export → Policy markdown generated successfully

ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION
----------------------
Required Environment Variables:
❌ NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL (placeholder value)
❌ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (placeholder value)
❌ GEMINI_API_KEY (not set)

Database Migrations:
Status: Cannot verify (no database connection)
Expected: 2 migrations (schema + NIST knowledge base)

Rate Limits/Timeouts:
- Not configured (no active services)
- Gemini API: No rate limiting implemented
- Supabase: Default limits (not connected)

PRODUCTION BUILD
---------------
Status: FAILED
Command: npm run build
Error: Missing icon exports (UserGroupIcon, EnvelopeIcon, CogIcon)

Bundle Analysis: Cannot complete due to build failure
TypeScript Check: FAILED
Lint Check: Not configured

SECURITY VALIDATION
------------------
✅ XSS Protection: Implemented
✅ Input Sanitization: Active
✅ Error Handling: Secured
✅ Environment Variables: Not exposed to client
✅ RLS Policies: Defined (but untested)

Dev Server Exposure: ❌ N/A (build failed)
CORS Rules: ❌ Not configured
Auth Guards: ✅ Implemented (untested)
PII Logging: ✅ Disabled
Secrets Committed: ✅ None found

ACCESSIBILITY SCAN
-----------------
Tool: Not configured
Results: Manual review only
Findings: Cannot determine without build success

CONCLUSION
----------
System is NOT READY for production deployment due to:
1. Build system failures
2. Missing environment configuration
3. Database connectivity issues
4. Lack of test infrastructure
5. Incomplete icon library

Estimated Fix Time: 5-8 days
