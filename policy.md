## Policy Statements

### 1. Access Control (NIST CSF: PR.AC | ISO 27001: A.9)
The organization implements identity and access management based on least privilege and need-to-know principles. Access rights are granted based on job function, regularly reviewed, and promptly revoked when no longer required.

### 2. Authentication & Identity Management (NIST CSF: PR.AC-01 | ISO 27001: A.9.2)
Multi-factor authentication is required for all privileged accounts and remote access. Passwords must meet complexity requirements and be unique across systems. Identity lifecycle management processes ensure timely provisioning and deprovisioning.

### 3. Endpoint Security (NIST CSF: PR.PT | ISO 27001: A.8.1)
All endpoint devices are configured with approved security baselines, maintained with current patches, and protected with endpoint detection and response solutions. Personal devices accessing organizational resources must comply with mobile device management requirements.

### 4. Data Classification & Handling (NIST CSF: PR.DS | ISO 27001: A.8.2)
Information is classified as Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted based on sensitivity and regulatory requirements. Handling procedures are defined for each classification level, including storage, transmission, and disposal requirements.

### 5. Encryption at Rest & in Transit (NIST CSF: PR.DS-01, PR.DS-02 | ISO 27001: A.8.24)
Encryption using industry-standard algorithms protects sensitive data at rest and in transit. Cryptographic key management follows established standards with secure generation, distribution, storage, and destruction procedures.

### 6. Logging & Monitoring (NIST CSF: DE.AE, DE.CM | ISO 27001: A.8.15)
Security events are logged, monitored, and analyzed to detect potential threats and unauthorized activities. Log retention periods align with regulatory requirements and business needs. Security information and event management (SIEM) provides centralized monitoring.

### 7. Vulnerability Management (NIST CSF: DE.CM-08 | ISO 27001: A.8.8)
Vulnerabilities are identified through regular scanning, assessed for risk, and remediated within defined timelines. Critical vulnerabilities are addressed within 72 hours, high-risk within 30 days, and medium-risk within 90 days.

### 8. Change Management (NIST CSF: PR.IP-03 | ISO 27001: A.8.32)
All changes to information systems follow formal change management procedures with appropriate testing, approval, and rollback capabilities. Emergency changes require post-implementation review and documentation.

### 9. Backup & Recovery (NIST CSF: PR.IP-04 | ISO 27001: A.8.13)
Critical systems and data are backed up regularly with tested recovery procedures. Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) are defined based on business impact analysis and regulatory requirements.

### 10. Third-Party Risk Management (NIST CSF: ID.SC | ISO 27001: A.5.19)
Third-party providers undergo security assessments before engagement and periodic reassessments. Contracts include security requirements, audit rights, and incident notification obligations. Access is limited to necessary systems and data.

### 11. Incident Response (NIST CSF: RS | ISO 27001: A.5.24)
Security incidents are reported immediately through established channels and managed according to documented procedures. Incident response team coordinates containment, investigation, and recovery efforts with appropriate stakeholder communication.

### 12. Acceptable Use (NIST CSF: PR.AT | ISO 27001: A.6.4)
Information systems are used only for authorized business purposes. Personal use is limited to reasonable levels that don't interfere with business operations or create security risks. Prohibited activities are clearly defined and enforced.

### 13. Security Awareness & Training (NIST CSF: PR.AT-01 | ISO 27001: A.6.3)
All personnel receive security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. Role-specific training is provided for positions with elevated security responsibilities. Phishing simulation and other security exercises reinforce awareness.

### 14. Physical & Environmental Security (NIST CSF: PR.AC-02 | ISO 27001: A.7)
Physical access to facilities and information processing areas is controlled through appropriate mechanisms. Environmental controls protect against power failures, natural disasters, and other physical threats to information systems.
